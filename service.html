    <h2>The Big Event</h2>
    <img src="BigEvent.jpg" width="500px">
    <p>In my Sophomore year of college, I participated in the Big Event, a large-scale 
        service event where many students get together to help the community. Local residents
        apply for labor, specifying what job needs to be done as well as the tools needed
        to complete it. I joined through a friend of mine's organization, working in a group
        of 10 students, some were people I knew, and others were strangers to me. For my task,
        we were required to remove an old concrete path in the resident's front yard, moving
        the chunks of concrete to the edge of the property to be disposed of later. Overall,
        I grew closer to the people in my group, getting to know new people in my school, and
        felt a deep satisfaction upon completing the task, knowing that we helped someone in 
        our community.

    <h2>Aggie Habitat for Humanity</h2>
    <img src="Habitat.jpeg" width="500px">
    <p>Aggie Habitat for Humanity is a College org associated with the actual Habitat for Humanity,
        and similar to the real organization, our task is to help the Bryan-College Station Area by
        building homes for people who are in need. The process goes as follows: A family first needs
        to apply for a home, and when they are accepted, they must work with us to help build the 
        house. When no houses are being built, this student org also volunteers to help with other 
        services around Campus, such as cleaning the stadium.

    <h2>The 12th Can</h2> 
    <img src="TwelfthCan.jpeg" width="500px">
    <p>The 12th Can is a food pantry service organization. However, this club is unique compared to
        other food pantry service orgs as the members get to see the people face to face when they
        are shopping at the pantry. A member's role in this club is both to restock the pantries, and 
        to serve customers who visit the shop. Food security is a big problem in society, and I am
        hoping to be able to make a difference by being in this organization.
