    <h3>SNAIC</h3>
    <img src="SNAIC.png">
    <p>SNAIC stands for Seamless Neural Artificial Intelligence Capturer; basically, the program
        is meant to take a picture and capture any objects in the picture. The goal of the app was
        for users to be able to find products they were looking for by taking pictures of them, where
        then the app would find a link to purchase the item. I was part of the AI team, working with 
        META's Segment Anything Model, and our job was to configure the model to identify objects
        based on where the user clicks on the screen.

    <img src="CharityPage.png">
    <p>Being part of the Global Career Accelerator, one of our tasks was to build a landing page for
        the company charity:water. From this project, I learned about marketing strategies as well as 
        following branding guidelines.
