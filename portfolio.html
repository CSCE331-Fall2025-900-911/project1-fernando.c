                A product of the <a href="https://getinvolved.tamu.edu/org/aggiecodingclub">Aggie Coding Club</a>, SNAIC stands for Seamless Neural Artificial
                Intelligence Capturer; basically, the program is meant to take a picture and 
                capture any objects in the picture. The goal of the app was for users to be able
                to find products they were looking for by taking pictures of them, where then
                the app would find a link to purchase the item. I was part of the AI team, working 
                with META's Segment Anything Model, and our job was to configure the model to 
                identify objects based on where the user clicks on the screen.

                Being part of the Global Career Accelerator, one of our tasks was to build a landing 
                page for the company charity:water. From this project, I learned about marketing strategies 
                as well as following branding guidelines.
